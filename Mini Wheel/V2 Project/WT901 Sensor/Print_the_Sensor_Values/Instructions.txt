Instructions:

Wiring: Connect the WT901 to the ESP32 Mini using I2C (SDA to GPIO 21, SCL to GPIO 22 by default).
Install Libraries: Ensure that the Wire library is included.
Adjust I2C Address: Make sure the I2C address (WT901_ADDRESS) is correct for your setup.
Upload Code: Upload the code to your ESP32 Mini and open the Serial Monitor to see the gyroscope values.
